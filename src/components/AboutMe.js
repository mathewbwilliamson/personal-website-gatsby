    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>I'm a <span class='red'>full-stack</span> web engineer.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I <span class='red'>loved</span> technology. Whether it was playing around on my dad's old brick of a laptop, or programming on a state-of-the-art modern machine, it was <span class='red'>always fun</span>. I love figuring things out and <span class='red'>making them work</span>.</p>
    <p>Recently, I've been <span class='red'>exploring</span> modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and Express. Seeing that there are <span class='red'>no limits</span> to what I can build is amazing.</p>
    <p>In addition to programming, I love my two greyhounds, my two cats, and having fun playing boardgames.</p>
