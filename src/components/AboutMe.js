    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a full-stack web engineer.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I loved technology. Whether it was playing around on my dad's old brick of a laptop, or programming on a state-of-the-art modern machine, it was always fun. I love figuring things out and making them work.</p>
    <p>Recently, I've been exploring modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and Express. Seeing that there are no limits to what I can build is amazing.</p>
    <p>In addition to programming, I love my two greyhounds, my two cats, and having fun playing boardgames.</p>
